# Job offer: Postdoctoral researcher in AI/ML for Antimicrobial Drug Discovery

**About Ersilia**

The Fundació Ersilia Open Source Initiative (Ersilia) is a non-profit organization building open source AI/ML tools to support infectious disease research across the Global South. Founded in 2020, the Ersilia team has developed an array of methods and infrastructure to provide free service to researchers working in resource-limited settings, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ersilia’s current focus is to speed up drug discovery for diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, AMR or schistosomiasis.&#x20;

**What are we looking for?**

This project focuses on developing AI/ML models for antimicrobial drug discovery. The postdoctoral researcher will be leading the development of a) Bioactivity prediction models for key pathogens of Global Health concern and b) Generative AI modeling to expand the known chemical space for antiinfectives. Following Ersilia’s open source mandate, all models and data from this project will be publicly available and deployed through a unified web application framework, designed to serve researchers globally, especially those with limited access to advanced computational resources.

The postdoctoral researcher will join Ersilia’s core team and will be supervised by Dr. Miquel Duran-Frigola, Ersilia’s co-founder and Lead Scientist. This position is supported by the Plan Generación Conocimiento 2024 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (REF)
